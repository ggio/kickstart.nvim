My Neovim configuration, based on [Kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) (as a starting point) and [benbrastmckie/.config](https://github.com/benbrastmckie/.config) (for latex related plugins and settings).

Some added features, plugins and tweaks:

* Made Kickstart.nvim **modular**, for readability and maintenance.
* [oil.nvim] -- as file/directory explorer.
* [markdown-preview](https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim) and [md-to-html](https://github.com/realprogrammersusevim/md-to-html.nvim) -- for working with md files.
* [rainbow_csv](https://github.com/cameron-wags/rainbow_csv.nvim) -- for working with csv files.
* [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) - LaTeX filetype and syntax.
